# Methods for Assigning MIDI Note Numbers to Objects

There are five main ways to assign MIDI note numbers to objects. Each method has its own advantages and use cases.

Methods 1-4 use the `Assign Notes to Object` node while method 5 uses the `Visual Note Map` node.

## 1. Object Name with Embedded Note Number

In this method, the note number is directly embedded in the object's name, separated by an underscore.

- **Format**: ObjectName_NoteNumber
- **Example**:

```other
Cube_60 => Note 60
Cube_61 => Note 61
Cube_62 => Note 62
Cube_63 => Note 63
```

- **Pros**: Simple and straightforward
- **Cons**: Inflexible, requires consistent naming convention

## 2. Direct Assignment from MIDI Track

This method assigns note numbers based on the order of unique notes in a MIDI track.

- **Input**: MIDI track with unique note numbers [60, 61, 62, 63]
- **Assignment**:

```other
Cube.000 => Note 60
Cube.001 => Note 61
Cube.002 => Note 62
Cube.003 => Note 63
```

- **Pros**: Flexible, allows for dynamic assignment
- **Cons**: Requires exact match between number of objects and unique MIDI notes

## 3. Flexible Assignment with Padding

This method is similar to the second, but adds flexibility when the number of objects doesn't match the number of unique MIDI notes.

### Example A: Fewer MIDI notes than objects

- **Input**: MIDI track with unique note numbers [60, 63]
- **Padding**: Function expands to [60, 61, 62, 63]
- **Assignment**:

```other
Cube.000 => Note 60
Cube.001 => Note 61
Cube.002 => Note 62
Cube.003 => Note 63
```

### Example B: More MIDI notes than objects

- **Input**: MIDI track with unique note numbers [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]
- **Assignment**: Use available notes until objects are exhausted

```other
Cube.000 => Note 60
Cube.001 => Note 61
Cube.002 => Note 62
Cube.003 => Note 63
```

- **Pros**: Most flexible, handles mismatches between object count and note count
- **Cons**: May require additional logic for padding or truncation

## 4. User-Provided Object List

This method allows users to directly input note numbers, but requires that the number of notes matches the number of objects.

**User inputs:** [60, 61, 62, 63]

```other
Cube.000 => Note 60
Cube.001 => Note 61
Cube.002 => Note 62
Cube.003 => Note 63
```

**Note:** This input is hidden by default and needs to be enabled in the node properties.

## 5. Visual Mapping Method

This method offers the most flexibility but requires more setup. Unlike the previous methods which assume a 1:1 mapping and one animation curve, the visual mapping approach allows for:

- Assigning multiple notes to objects
- Applying multiple animations to objects

### Key Features:

- Highly flexible assignment process
- Can create complex relationships between notes, objects, and animations
- Ideal for advanced cases which need precise control over the setup

### Use Cases:

- When objects need to respond to multiple MIDI notes
- For creating layered or complex animations triggered by different notes
- In scenarios where different parts of an object should animate based on different MIDI inputs

While this method requires more initial setup, it provides the greatest degree of creative control and can be used to create more sophisticated MIDI-driven animations and interactions.
